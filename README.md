## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive images using `srcset` and `sizes`

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of writing semantic HTML and building accessible components. I practiced using `srcset` for responsive images and CSS techniques like `clamp()` for responsive spacing and typography.

Hereâ€™s a snippet I was happy with:

```css
.product-desc-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 1.3rem;
  padding: clamp(1.5rem, 4vw, 2rem);
}
```
